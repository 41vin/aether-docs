Subscriber and Device Management
================================

Subscriber management includes workflows associated with provisioning new subscribers, removing
existing subscribers, and associating subscribers with slices.

.. note::
    This section refers to a fully installed ROC GUI, properly secured and with Enterprises, Connectivity Services
    and Sites already configured by a ROC Administrator. The examples shown below are taken from an example
    configuration shipped with the ROC - the "MEGA Patch" (see :ref:`posting-the-mega-patch`)

Provisioning a new Device
-------------------------

Before a Device can be granted connectivity service, it must first be provisioned. This step is normally
performed by Aether Operations.

Each Device is assigned a PLMN and a set of security keys. Depending on the deployment scenario, these
keys might be shared by several Devices, or they might be unique to each Device. The allocation of PLMNs and
keys is currently performed manually by the Aether Operations team. This subscriber-related
detail is configured via the SIM Management application, ``simapp``.

``simapp.yaml`` needs to be adjusted to include the new Device IMSIs to the subscriber list. For example::

    # simapp.yaml
    # ...
    simapp.yaml:
        info:
          version: 1.0.0
          description: SIMAPP initial local configuration
        logger:
          # network function
          APP:
            debugLevel: info
            ReportCaller: false
        configuration:
          provision-network-slice: false
          subscribers:
          - ueId-start: 123456789123458
            ueId-end: 123456789123458
            plmnId: 20893
            opc: 8e27b6af0e692e750f32667a3b14605d
            key: 8baf473f2f8fd09487cccbd7097c6862
            sequenceNumber: 16f3b3f70fc2
          - ueId-start: 123456789123460
            ueId-end: 123456789123465
            plmnId: 20893
            opc: 8e27b6af0e692e750f32667a3b14605d
            key: 8baf473f2f8fd09487cccbd7097c6862
            sequenceNumber: 16f3b3f70fc2

The simapp configurations for all deployments are stored in the ``aether-app-configs`` repository:

* Production deployment: ``apps/sd-core-4g/overlays/prd-acc-gcp1/values.yaml``
* Staging deployment: ``apps/sd-core-4g/overlays/stg-acc-aws/values.yaml``

Fleet will automatically deploy changes to these files once they are merged.

.. _configure_device_group:

Configure Connectivity Service for a new Device
-----------------------------------------------

To receive connectivity service, the following steps are necessary:

1. The Sim-Card for the Device must be created.
2. The Device must be created and associated with the Sim-Card.
3. The Device must be added to a Device-Group.

Create the Sim-Card
"""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
    If Simapp integration has been enabled on the site, then new Sim-Cards will automatically be
    added to the Site as the Aether staff provisions the SIM Cards. In that case, the Sim-Card object
    will already be present, and this section may be skipped.

Start by bringing up the Sim-Card list:

|SIMCARD-LIST|

Click the add button to add a new Sim-Card:

|SIMCARD-ADD|

Select an Enterprise and Site where the Sim-Card will belong.
Give the Sim-Card a unique ID. You must also set the IMSI for the Sim-Card, which should have
been provided by Aether operations. All other fields, including the ICCID, are optional.
Update and Commit the changes when you are finished.

Creating the Device
"""""""""""""""""""

To create the Device, start by navigating to the Device list:

|DEVICE-LIST|

Click the add button to add a new Device:

|DEVICE-ADD|

Select an Enterprise and Site where the Device will belong.
Give the Device a unique ID and select a Sim-Card to associate with the Device. It
is allowed to create the Device with no Sim-Card, in case you want to associate the Sim-Card
at a later date. All other fields, including the IMEI, are optional.
Update and Commit the changes when you are finished.

Adding the Device to the Device-Group
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

An Enterprise is typically
organized into one or more Sites, each Site which may contain one or more DeviceGroups. Navigate
to the appropriate DeviceGroup which is associated with the Site you wish to deploy on, and add
the Device's IMSI to the DeviceGroup.

The Site details can be seen by navigating to the Site list view.

|SITE-LIST|

In the ROC GUI, navigate to the Device Groups list view, to see the list of
Device Groups and their association to Sites.

|DEVICEGROUP-LIST|

In the Device-Group *New York POS* example above there are two devices listed,
*till-pos-1* and *till-pos-2*.

.. note::
    A Device may participate in at most one DeviceGroup, and that DeviceGroup may
    participate in at most one Slice.

Editing
*******
Edit the DeviceGroup by clicking on the Edit icon, and in the List page,
adjust an existing Device ID range or create a new range (by clicking on the `+` icon).

|DEVICEGROUP-EDIT|

The Device-Group page includes a list of each device that comprises the group. Each one
may be individually enabled or disabled. Enable or disable is intended to temporarily
limit connectivity; the device can also be permanently deleted. To add a device to the group, click the
plus symbol next to the device, and then select an available device.

.. note::
   While you are allowed to add a device to multiple device groups, this is not recommended.

When the entries on the DeviceGroup edit page are valid the **Update** will become available

* Click this to add the changes to the **Basket** of configuration changes
* Observe that the **Basket** icon (2nd icon from top right) displays the number of changes

.. note::
    The changes are not committed to **aether-config** until the **Basket** is committed.
    This allows several changes to be gathered together in one transaction and checked before committing.

Remove Connectivity Service from an existing Device
---------------------------------------------------

Using the ROC GUI, navigate to the DeviceGroup that contains the Device,
then remove that Device from the list.

* Once finished editing, proceed to the *Basket View*, inspect the changes and Commit.

|DEVICEGROUP-EDIT|

.. note::
    The Device may continue to have connectivity until its next detach/attach cycle.

Create a new DeviceGroup
------------------------

DeviceGroups allow Devices to be grouped and configured together. Each site comes preconfigured with
a default DeviceGroup, but additional DeviceGroups may be created. For example, placing all IP
Cameras in an "my-site-ip-cameras" DeviceGroup would allow you to group IP Cameras together.

To add a DeviceGroup, navigate to the list of DeviceGroups and click `Add` in the upper right.
(This may be grayed out if you do not have appropriate permissions).

* Specify a unique **id** for the DeviceGroup
    40 characters max and only alphanumeric and `-`, `_` and `.` allowed
* Choose an *Enterprise* and *Site* from the preconfigured list
    It will not be possible to add Devices until the Site is chosen
* Devices can be added at this stage or later
* As part of the DeviceGroup, you may select a maximum bitrate (MBR)
  that will be used for the devices in the group. This bitrate is applied
  separately to each device within the group -- it is not an aggregate
  of all devices within the group.
  For more information see the section on :ref:`metering`.


|DEVICEGROUP-ADD|

Delete a DeviceGroup
--------------------

If a DeviceGroup is no longer needed, it can be deleted. Deleting a DeviceGroup will not cause
the Devices participating in the group to automatically be moved elsewhere.

.. note::
    If a Device Group is being used by an existing Slice, then it cannot be removed.
    Delete the Slice first, and then the DeviceGroup.

A DeviceGroup can be deleted from the DeviceGroup list view, by clicking the *trash can* icon
next to it. The deletion is added to the **Basket** directly. Navigate to the *Basket View*
to commit the change.

|DEVICEGROUP-LIST|


Add a DeviceGroup to a Slice
----------------------------

In order to participate in the connectivity service, a DeviceGroup must be associated with
a Slice.

Navigate to the *Slice* list view to see the list of Slice's and their associations to DeviceGroups.

|SLICE-LIST|

To edit a *Slice* click on the *edit* button next to it in this list.

This brings up the Slice edit page where (among many other things) zero, one or many
DeviceGroups can be associated with it.

* Click the *trash can* symbol to remove a DeviceGroup from the Slice
* Click the *+* icon to add a DeviceGroup
* Click the *Enable* slider to Enable or Disable the DeviceGroup
   * This is a way of disabling or reenabling the DeviceGroup within a Slice without having to remove it
