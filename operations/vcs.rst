VCS Management
==============

A **VCS** (Virtual Cellular Service) is a slice of network access for a set of UEs with a defined set of
QOS parameters.

To define a VCS requires it to be associated with:

* an Enterprise
* a Site
* one or more **Filter** (Application)
* one or more **DeviceGroup**
* a **UPF**

and must also be created with attributes like:

* **SD** (slice differentiator)
* **SST** (slice/service type)
* **Default Behavior** (for Application Filtering)
* **Uplink** (data rate in bps)
* **Downlink** (data rate in bps)

Provisioning a new VCS
----------------------

.. note::
    This section refers to a fully installed ROC GUI, properly secured and with Enterprises, Connectivity Services
    Applications, and Sites already configured by a ROC Administrator. The examples shown below are taken from an example
    configuration shipped with the ROC - the "MEGA Patch" (see :ref:`posting-the-mega-patch`)

This procedure assumes you have already set up one or more DeviceGroups, containing
configuration for a number of UEs. Follow the procedure in :ref:`configure_device_group`
to configure DeviceGroups.

To add a new VCS, click the **Add** button in the VCS List View.

|VCS-LIST|

In the resulting VCS edit page:

#. Enter a VCS ID (this must be unique across the whole system).
#. Enter a Display Name (optional).
#. Enter a Description (optional).
#. Choose an Enterprise (may already have been selected)
#. Choose a Site
#. Choose a template

    * this will copy over values from that template, which may be edited individually at this create stage
    * they will not be editable afterwards.
#. Accept the Default Behavior, SD and SST, and Uplink and Downlink values or change them.
#. Choose a *UPF* from the drop down list.

    * UPFs will previously have been added to a pool - those remaining unused will appear for selection.

One or more Filters (Applications) and/or DeviceGroups can be associated with the VCS at this
stage or later, by clicking on the *+* icon.

When chosen, they appear as a list in the VCS edit page, and are automatically enabled/allowed:

Click on the "Update" to add these changes to the *Basket*.

Click the **Commit** in the *Basket View* to commit the changes. See :ref:`committing`.

Editing an existing VCS
-----------------------
When editing an existing VCS, it will not be possible to change:

* The **id**.
* The **template** or the *SD* or *SST* parameters beneath it.

Existing *Filters* or *DeviceGroups* can be removed by clicking the *trash can* icon next to it.

Alternatively existing *Filters* or *DeviceGroups* can be *disabled/disallowed* by clicking the slider
next to it. This will have the same effect as disabling it.

.. note:: The *DeviceGroup* or *Filter* and *UPF* here are *references*. If the underlying object is modified, then
    the changes on the VCS will take effect whenever changes to those objects are committed.

Removing a VCS
--------------
Removing a VCS can be achieved by clicking the *trash can* icon next to the VCS in the
VCS List page

Monitoring a VCS
----------------

The performance of a VCS can be monitored in many ways, by clicking its |monitor| (**monitor**) icon:

* From the **Dashboard** page, which shows all VCS's belonging to an Enterprise.
* From the VCS List Page - click the |monitor| icon for the VCS.
* When editing an existing VCS - in the Edit page, the |monitor| is next to the *id*

The *monitor* page itself shows:

* A link to the Monitoring page of each Device Group. See :ref:`monitor_device_group`.
* Information panels for each sub-object of the VCS

    * Clicking on the down arrow expands each panel
