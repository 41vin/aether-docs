About
=====

The Aether Project is transitioning to a new automated testing regime,
consistent with its transition from being a managed service to being
a platform anyone can deploy. Information about the previous framework
can be found in the `Version 2.1 Guide
<https://docs.aetherproject.org/aether-2.1/testing/about_system_tests.html>`__.

The major changes include:

* Adopting gNBsim (in place of NG40) as the primary test engine for SD-Core.
* Developing new integration tests for a range of configuration options.
* Dropping support for SD-Fabric tests.

For detailed information on component-level tests, please see their
respective Guides:

* :doc:`SD-Core Documentation <sdcore:index>`
* :doc:`SD-RAN Documentation <sdran:index>`

More information about interface testing is include in the :doc:`API
Tests Section </testing/aether-roc-tests>` of this Guide.
